## **Configuration Options**

- The theme has a simple set of options that can be changed directly from the UI Settings menu of ES-DE 
   - Options:
   - `Theme Aspect Ratio`- sets the aspect ratio the theme will render at. If needed, this should be changed to match the aspect ratio of your screen.
   - `Theme Variant`- sets the layout used for the gamelist view when media & metadata are scraped for your games
   - `Color`- sets the color scheme that is used for the overall theme on all views
- 16:9, 16:10 and 4:3 aspect ratios are currently supported
- there are 2 gamelist layouts to choose from (metadata-on & metadata-off)
- and 4 pre-built color schemes are currently available with the option of creating your own customized color scheme through a simple XML file (details below)

## User Customizations
The following can be changed directly from the ES-DE menu interface under `UI Settings`

```
Apsect Ratio Options:

If you change the color scheme option to `custom` then you can change values in the `color-scheme-custom.xml` file to match the colors you prefer.  I am happy to add additional colors to the pre-built list too; so if you create one that you are comfortable with sharing please post it here: https://retropie.org.uk/forum/topic/33010/theme-art-book-next

## **To-Do**
(a quick list of items I am looking to add)
* Add 3:2 & 5:3 Aspect Ratios
* Create and add any missing background art
* Add the ability to provide custom background art

## **Additional Notes**

### Scraping:
* Please make sure the following are set to be scraped under Scraper > Content Settings:
   * Game Names
   * Ratings
   * Other Metadata
   * Videos
   * Screenshots
   * Box Cover Images
   * Marquee (Wheel) Images
* Other media is optional and will be used in cases where one of the above is missing (for example Title Screen images will be used if screenshots are missing)
* This theme does not display miximages so if you have those scraped they will not be used.

### Versions for other ES forks:
* If you use Retropie or ES-DE v1.x or eariler... then check out the version [here](https://github.com/anthonycaccese/art-book-next-retropie).
* If you use Batocera... then check out the version [here](https://github.com/anthonycaccese/es-theme-art-book-next/archive/2.0.zip).  The Batocera version has all the same base features but simply makes them available to change through Batocera's menu UI (i.e. you don't need to touch the XML as discussed above).  It also adds some additional features such as the theming of the menu and the ability to toggle on/off the display of different media elements directly through the menu ui as well.
